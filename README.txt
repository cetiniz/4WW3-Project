Form validation for JavaScript was activated upon the onsubmit event. However, I also included a dynamic removal of red borders through the onfocus event.

The sites URL should be: https://cetiniz.cs4ww3.ca/
If you cannot access the site due to routing (or some permissions that were not enabled) email me at cetiniz@mcmaster.ca. I am fairly certain the site should be accessable outside of my IP
